# K-Means-Clustering
The K-Means-Clustering Algorithm
SuperDatascience project but retouched by me
This repository contains the project organised by SuperDataScience for the purpose of the course machine learning A-Z https://sds-platform-private.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/P14-Part4-Clustering.zip

Aim:
To help determine which customer will buy a particular goods from the mall

Objective:
To develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a customer buying a particular goods

Packages
Scikit learn Pandas Numpy 

Models
The solution was built on two models -K-Means_Clustering but for Clustering Problems
